# MapSocket
Request-response mapped WebSocket implementation.

**Don't use this library in production code, it is only intended as a coding challenge and is therefore not complete, nor properly tested!**

## Requirements
The project must fulfil the following requirements:
* implementation of a Node.JS library that provides request-response mapping on top of WebSockets
* implementation of a Vue (or React) -based UI project that showcases the implemented library in use

There are two additional constrations for the task:
* use the [ws](https://github.com/websockets/ws) library on the server-side
* no additional external dependencies are allowed, except those necessary for building / testing

## Scope
First of all, the requirements have to be broken down into smaller units of work. After analysis, the following individual tasks have been identified:

* implementation of the MapSocket Node.JS library
* implementation of an example project that uses the MapSocket on the server-side
* implementation of an example project thtat uses MapSocket on the client-side
* write documentation and user-manual
